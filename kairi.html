        Kairi Panha Cha is a traditional Maharashtrian raw 
        mango drink and is enormously famous during the summer 
        season, used as a refreshment drink. Mostly the mangoes 
        chosen are Alphonso and Salem Gundu. This drink takes 
        hardly 7 to 8 minutes to be prepared and it works 
        tremendously advantageous in relaxing someone when served 
        chilled. In order to improvise the drink, the cardamom is 
        ground along with its peel to give a better flavour.
