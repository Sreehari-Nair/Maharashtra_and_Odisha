        Sabudana is 'sago' or tapioca starch. Khichdi roughly means 'mixture'. 
        This unique dish is a popular breakfast item in Maharashtra food and 
        cuisine and is one of the few food products which is consumed during 
        the period of holy-fasting, 'upwaas'. The granular texture of sago 
        prepared in a savoury mix turns out to be a delicious dish indeed.
