        The much famed Ragda Patties or as the locals would name it Ragda 'pattice' 
        (a localised version on the English 'patties') is a part of Maharashtra's 
        delicious street food that one should never leave out on. It is a yet another 
        lip-smacking street food in Mumbai which is prepared by using curried dried 
        peas and patties. These potato patties are dipped in the Ragda gravy and topped 
        with chaat chutneys, finely chopped onions, tomatoes, crispy sev and cilantro. 
        The dish is regularly served at all restaurants in Maharashtra and is also an 
        important part of the local street food as well. <a href="mahafood.html">Back Page</a>.
