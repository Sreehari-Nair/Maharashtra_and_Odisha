        This delectable food item is a sweet version of the loving parantha.
        The stuffing is made from jaggery (gur), yellow gram (chana) dal,
        plain flour, cardamom powder and ghee (clarified butter). 
        It is a popular dish in festive occasions and also can be eaten at 
        any time of the day. A tasty dessert does not need 
        anyone's permission to be eaten! <a href="mahafood.html">Back page</a>.
