        Gupchup, which is known as ‘puchka’ in Bengal, ‘golgappa’ 
        in the north, and ‘panipuri’ in western India, is the nation’s 
        favourite food. In this dish, crunchy hollow balls made from maida, 
        atta, or suji; filled with chana masala and dipped in spicy jal jeera, 
        just enough to take your taste buds on a whirlwind of flavours. The 
        sheer burst of the gupchup in the mouth, one of the most famous 
        dishes of Odisha, makes this crispy wonder an absolute delight 
        that one can binge-eat on their trip to Odisha.
