        Say hello to the cheesecake of Odisha â€“ Chhena Poda. 
        You will be left obsessing over this delicacy long 
        after eating it. Baked for hours at a stretch, this 
        dish is made from burnt home-made cottage cheese, 
        sugar syrup, and semolina. The caramelized sugar of 
        Chhena Poda imparts a distinctive taste to it and is 
        one of those dishes of Odisha which you can find in 
        every lane and by-lane of the state. <a href="odifood.html">Back page</a>.
